								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_3229.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Pradip Shrestha is an environmental service professional and geospatial expert in climate change, ecosystem assessment, and hazard mapping. I am a service-oriented professional and highly-skilled in applying geo-statistical analysis of a variety of raw and large dataset. I am well-versed in statistical programming languages e.g. R and Python - and relevant geoprocessing packages to extract and access geospatial information. I am conversant with a variety of cloud-based geospatial systems and machine learning approach, such as Google Earth Engine and ArcGIS. I am a detail-oriented person with great communication and presentation skills, and I excel both on my own as well as in a team setting.</p>
								<p>I am a lifelong learner with an unyielding enthusiasm for data. I have used data to help inform decisions in both my professional, personal life and contributing for social cause. I believe that my passion will continue to grow as I learn more about its potential applications and continue to explore the various ways in which it can be used to solve problems. I am eager to learn more about the latest developments in geospatial research and development and to continue to play an active role in the data-driven world. I’m currently learning machine learning modules for image segmentation and integrating spatial analysis for cloud computing. </p>
								<p>Fun fact: I am a novice photographer and a foodie !!! </p>

								<h3> From Pixels to Insights: Studying the Surface Phenology based on Texture in Cropping Environment </h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/lacunarity.png"" width="50%" /></span>
								<p> I am conducting a comprehensive evaluations of radar and satellite time series within cropping systems. Leveraging automated tools, I perform spatial analysis and curate data. My advanced programming skills in Python and R allow me to optimize spatial trends and time series. Additionally, I utilize tools like ENVI, SNAP, and ArcGIS Pro for data visualization. This efficient transition from raw data to charts and figures ensures the accuracy of descriptive and textural analyses. Aditionally, I have prepared metadata for processed data to document the context and characteristics of the spatial data, ensuring proper interpretation and reproducibility. </p>

								<h3><a href="https://graham.umich.edu/product/procedure-impervious-surface-mapping-gis-based-approach">Machine Learning for Impervious Surface Mapping</a></h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/impervious.png"" width="50%" /></span>
								<p> Developing green infrastructures requires a thorough analysis of the surface features like drainage networks, surface elevations, soil condition, and groundwater-to which impervious condition is a prerequisite. The incorporation of machine learning capabilities into geospatial technologies makes mapping the impervious surface area in an urban landscape cost-effective, consistent, and repeatable. At the project end, a multi-layered dataset displaying parcel level imperviousness is produced that can aid in GSI suitability and resiliency planning initiatives. Additionally, the dataset can be used as a baseline for urban landscape research and planning, and support the development of a consistent and defendable stormwater utility program.</p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/harry.jpeg" alt="" width="50%"/></span>
								<p> I explored relationships between Harry Potter's characters from the perspective of social networks using NetworkX and Pyvis. The relationships (edges) between characters are depicted graphically in networks (nodes) based on centrality- between and closeness. Here I estimate intricate patterns of relationships provided by network analysis, and the network's basic characteristics gleaned from examination of network's structure. Analyzing complex character relationships can aid in reading a novel with too many characters because readers are frequently perplexed by complex character relationships.</p>

								<h3> Climate change Impact Assessment of Ecosystem Service in the Great Lakes Using Fuzzy Cognative Mapping</h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/fuzzy.png" alt="" width="50%"/></span>
								<p> This project is part of group work with comprises of team consisting of four graduate students and supervisors. The client for the project was Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR). </p>
								<p> Human well-being and economic success depend on the ecosystem services that the Great Lakes supply. It is crucial that we increase our understanding of how stressors affect ecosystem services if we are to comprehend the effects of climate change and create effective strategies for adapting to it. Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM), which we used to encode expert knowledge about interactions among ecosystem components, transform that subjective, qualitative data into predictions of the consequences of management on an ecosystem. Using interdisciplinary research, we identified which ecosystem functions—particularly provisioning services such as fishing, boating, and winter recreation—are most likely to be negatively impacted by climate stress, whereas birdwatching is anticipated to have a favorable rise. </p>
								<p>A cognition model, such as FCM, depicts a system in a way that closely resembles how humans perceive it, as a result, even a non-professional audience can understand the model, and each parameter has a recognizable meaning. The goal of the study was to develop a conceptual model that combines a holistic view of the ecosystem, its processes, and promotes interdisciplinarity by integrating different disciplines and fields of knowledge, as well as a horizontal relationship between scientists and local actors. In terms of ecology, these models are a significant step forward in our understanding of how top-down and bottom-up processes influence the regulation of key ecosystem services. </p>

								<h3> <a href="https://pradipfionalab.shinyapps.io/finalproject_501/">Crime Mapping of Detroit, 2011-2014</a></h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/crime.png" alt="" width="50%"/></span>
								<p>Is there an spatial distribution of crimes, for each day within the week/months, in Detroit?</p>
								<p>Crime has a geographical component that is inherent to it, and as crimes always take place in specific places, spatiality is crucial to the study of crimes. Before to developing a strategy or policy, it is crucial to identify the elements that cause crimes in order to avoid and respond to them. Using crime data from the City of Detroit Data Portal, this research examines the spatial and temporal dimensions of crime in a Detroit neighborhood from 2011 to 2014.</p>

								<h3> Urban Scaling in Midwerstern USA</h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/urban.png" alt="" width="50%"/></span>
								<p>The most dynamic landscapes are seen in urban areas, which display expansion and development while maintaining unique characteristics and features. It is vital to have a greater scientific understanding of urban dynamics and their applications in the backdrop of rapidly urbanizing societies, particularly in developing nations. Urban scaling rules enable a better understanding of urban systems by relating socio-economic, physical, and demographic factors to the population size of cities. We consider Bettencourt's theory of scaling, among other theories, to study the more general relationships between a city's size and its urban indicators. This theory makes the assumption that a city's population, as a measure of its size at any given time, exhibits a power relation with respect to socio-economic outputs and urban infrastructure.</p>
								<p> The study spans across 218 cities (65 metro and 153 micro economic units) within 20 km buffer from the Great Plains including ND, SD, MN, NE, IA, KS, MO, OK, TX. Urban impervious surface data as a percentage of the developed surface at 30 m pixels was obtained for 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016 from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Social and economic variables including population, Gross-Dometic Product (GDP) and Personal Income (PI) for 2001 through 2016 corresponding to the micropolitan and metropolitan statistical area were obtained from US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. Administrative boundary in form of shapefiles were obtained from ESRI online and US census delineated urban extent boundaries from TIGER/Line shapefiles. </p>
								<P>The study extends upon the earlier work by Heneby & Krehbiel, 2019.</P>
