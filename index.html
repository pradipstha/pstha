								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/lacunarity.png" width="50%" /></span>
								<p> I am conducting a comprehensive evaluations of radar and satellite time series within cropping systems in the USA. Leveraging automated tools, I performed spatial analysis and curate data. My advanced programming skills in Python and R allow me to optimize spatial trends and time series. Additionally, I utilized tools like ENVI, SNAP, and ArcGIS Pro for data visualization. This efficient transition from raw data to charts and figures ensures the accuracy of descriptive and textural analyses.

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/impervious.png" width="50%" /></span>
								<p> Developing green infrastructures requires a thorough analysis of the surface features like drainage networks, surface elevations, soil condition, and groundwater-to which impervious condition is a prerequisite. The incorporation of machine learning capabilities into geospatial technologies makes mapping the impervious surface area in an urban landscape cost-effective, consistent, and repeatable. At the project end, a multi-layered dataset displaying parcel level imperviousness is produced that can aid in GSI suitability and resiliency planning initiatives. Additionally, the dataset can be used as a baseline for urban landscape research and planning, and support the development of a consistent and defendable stormwater utility program.</p>

								<p> I explored relationships between Harry Potter's characters from the perspective of social networks using NetworkX and Pyvis. The relationships (edges) between characters are depicted graphically in networks (nodes) based on centrality- between and closeness. Here I estimate intricate patterns of relationships provided by network analysis, and the network's basic characteristics gleaned from examination of network's structure.

								<h3> Climate change Impact Assessment of Ecosystem Service in the Great Lakes Using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping</h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/fuzzy.png" alt="" width="50%"/></span>
								<p> This project is part of group work with comprises of team consisting of four graduate students and supervisors. The client for the project was Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR). </p>
								<p> Human well-being and economic success depend on the ecosystem services that the Great Lakes supply. It is crucial that we increase our understanding of how stressors affect ecosystem services if we are to comprehend the effects of climate change and create effective strategies for adapting to it. Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM), which we used to encode expert knowledge about interactions among ecosystem components, transform that subjective, qualitative data into predictions of the consequences of management on an ecosystem. Using interdisciplinary research, we identified which ecosystem functions—particularly provisioning services such as fishing, boating, and winter recreation—are most likely to be negatively impacted by climate stress, whereas birdwatching is anticipated to have a favorable rise. </p>
								<p>A cognition model, such as FCM, depicts a system in a way that closely resembles how humans perceive it, as a result, even a non-professional audience can understand the model, and each parameter has a recognizable meaning. The goal of the study was to develop a conceptual model that combines a holistic view of the ecosystem, its processes, and promotes interdisciplinarity by integrating different disciplines and fields of knowledge, as well as a horizontal relationship between scientists and local actors. In terms of ecology, these models are a significant step forward in our understanding of how top-down and bottom-up processes influence the regulation of key ecosystem services. </p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/crime.png" alt="" width="50%"/></span>
								<p>Is there an spatial distribution of crimes, for each day within the week/months, in Detroit?</p>
								<p>Crime has a geographical component that is inherent to it, and as crimes always take place in specific places, spatiality is crucial to the study of crimes. Before to developing a strategy or policy, it is crucial to identify the elements that cause crimes in order to avoid and respond to them. Using crime data from the City of Detroit Data Portal, this research examines the spatial and temporal dimensions of crime in a Detroit neighborhood from 2011 to 2014.</p>

								<h3> Urban Scaling in Midwestern USA</h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/urban.png" alt="" width="50%"/></span>
								<p>The most dynamic landscapes are seen in urban areas, which display expansion and development while maintaining unique characteristics and features. It is vital to have a greater scientific understanding of urban dynamics and their applications in the backdrop of rapidly urbanizing societies, particularly in developing nations. Urban scaling rules enable a better understanding of urban systems by relating socio-economic, physical, and demographic factors to the population size of cities. We consider Bettencourt's theory of scaling, among other theories, to study the more general relationships between a city's size and its urban indicators. This theory makes the assumption that a city's population, as a measure of its size at any given time, exhibits a power relation with respect to socio-economic outputs and urban infrastructure.</p>
								<p> The study spans across 218 cities (65 metro and 153 micro economic units) within 20 km buffer from the Great Plains including ND, SD, MN, NE, IA, KS, MO, OK, TX. Urban impervious surface data as a percentage of the developed surface at 30 m pixels was obtained for 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016 from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Social and economic variables including population, Gross-Domestic Product (GDP) and Personal Income (PI) for 2001 through 2016 corresponding to the micropolitan and metropolitan statistical area were obtained from US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. Administrative boundary in form of shapefiles were obtained from ESRI online and US census delineated urban extent boundaries from TIGER/Line shapefiles. </p>
								<P>The study extends upon the earlier work by Heneby & Krehbiel, 2019.</P>

    <span class="post-title">From Physical Replicas to Digital Mirrors: Why Digital Twins Aren’t Novel and How GIS Accelerated Them</span>
    <span class="post-meta">Digital Twins · GIS · Remote Sensing · IoT · Simulation</span>
  </summary>

  <p>
    A digital twin is a continuously evolving digital representation of a real-world object, system, or process kept current through real-time and near-real-time data from sensors, devices, imagery, and operational systems. It allows decision-makers to monitor performance, test interventions, and run “what-if” scenarios in a controlled environment before changes are made in the real world.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the term “digital twin” feels modern, the underlying practice is not. Long before today’s AI-enabled platforms, researchers and engineers relied on high-fidelity replicas to safely observe complex behavior and validate responses under stress. In environmental science, <em>Biosphere 2</em> (Arizona) was designed as a controlled ecosystem replica to study interactions across atmosphere, water, soil, and living systems. In flood-risk and coastal engineering, the <em>Deltares Delta Flume</em> (Netherlands) replicates storm-wave conditions at near full scale to test how dunes, dikes, and coastal structures perform under extreme forcing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The contemporary shift is that these replicas are now increasingly digital, connected, and scalable, largely enabled by advances in GIS, remote sensing, IoT, cloud computing, and AI.
  </p>

  <h3>Digital Twins as an Ecosystem, not a Single Technology</h3>

  <p>
    A digital twin incorporates three realms: the physical environment, the digital representation, and the data exchange layer that keeps them synchronized. A successful city digital twin is not an isolated product of a single technology; it is an ecosystem of integrated components that represent, monitor, simulate, and improve the real city.
  </p>

  <p>
    A city-scale digital twin is built on interconnected technologies that create a continually evolving model of an urban environment. At its foundation is Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which provides spatial context—maps, roads, utilities, and terrain models—that form the backbone of a city twin. GIS ensures that every object, from a lamp post to a 100-storey building, is placed accurately in geographic space.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remote sensing complements GIS by supplying high-resolution satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, drone photogrammetry, and thermal or hyperspectral imagery to build precise 3D models and detect real-world changes over time. These datasets help keep the twin updated with ground truth.
  </p>

  <p>
    IoT and sensor networks provide the next critical layer. Without real-time data, a digital twin is only a static 3D model. IoT feeds the twin with live streams of traffic counts, energy use, air quality levels, water pressure, and weather conditions, turning the model into a dynamic “digital mirror” of the city.
  </p>

  <p>
    To interpret these data streams, AI and machine learning support demand forecasting, anomaly detection, behavioral predictions, and environmental simulations. AI can also support automated change detection from satellite or drone imagery, and generative AI can support 3D modeling, scenario exploration, and conversational interaction with the twin.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simulations form another indispensable component. Simulation engines—traffic models, flood models, agent-based models, or energy simulations—allow planners to test “what-if” scenarios before implementing solutions in the real world. Cloud infrastructure supports these workflows by storing, processing, and streaming large datasets at scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    City twins also rely on 3D/visualization engines to render terrain, 3D tiles, BIM objects, textures, lighting, and real-time animations. Cities are also integrating AR and VR to support inspection, communication, and scenario visualization. Additional technologies—such as blockchain for data integrity and edge computing for lower-latency processing—are also being explored in digital twin ecosystems.
  </p>

  <p>
    These components work as a stack: GIS provides the spatial backbone; remote sensing supports reality capture; IoT supports real-time operations; AI supports insight; simulation supports testing and validation; and 3D visualization supports communication and interaction.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Digital Twins Matter (and What Gets in the Way)</h3>

  <p>
    Digital twins deliver value by combining continuous monitoring with scenario simulation. This supports decision-making by helping planners and operators compare interventions, detect inefficiencies earlier, and allocate resources with more confidence. A common framing treats a digital twin as a GIS-anchored, continuously updated representation of urban systems that supports monitoring and “what-if” simulation for climate-risk planning—such as evaluating flood exposure under extreme rainfall and testing urban heat mitigation strategies before implementation (Batty, 2018).
  </p>

  <p>
    Building effective digital twins at scale also brings challenges. Data fragmentation and interoperability can make integration expensive and slow. Scaling to city-level complexity introduces multiple update cycles and accuracy levels across layers such as mobility, utilities, environment, base maps, and 3D context. Governance and institutional coordination can become bottlenecks, including decisions about ownership, authority, and collaboration across organizations. Cost, expertise, cybersecurity, and long-term maintenance also matter; without ongoing investment, a twin can degrade into a static visualization.
  </p>

  <p>
    Digital twins may be a modern label, but the practice of building high-fidelity representations to observe complex behavior and test decisions safely has a long lineage—from Biosphere 2 to the Deltares Delta Flume. What has changed is the ability to operationalize the idea at scale: GIS provides spatial structure, remote sensing and IoT help keep the model aligned with reality, and AI plus simulation support foresight. The result is not just a richer 3D model, but a decision-support capability that can strengthen planning and resilience when paired with interoperable data, clear governance, and a long-term operating plan.

  </summary>

  <p>
    Global risk is not equally distributed. Some places face dangerous levels of exposure, while others remain unprepared.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using World Economic Forum risk data, I mapped a Risk Index to show how countries differ in vulnerability to natural hazards and extreme events. The maps highlight global disparities in exposure, coping capacity, and long-term resilience.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also tracked temporal risk trajectories for the top 10 high-risk countries, alongside Nepal. This work goes beyond ranking countries. It focuses on why some risks remain persistent and why others shift over time.
  </p>

  <p>This comparison raises two questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why do some countries with similar exposure show very different outcomes?</li>
    <li>Do we invest in resilience, or do we react after the fact?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Nepal does not appear among the top-ranked nations, even with high physical exposure to hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, and floods. A plausible hypothesis is that the index places significant weight on social vulnerability and governance. Nepal’s coping and adaptive capacities—relative to several least developed coastal nations—may keep its overall risk index below the top tier.
  </p>

  <p>
    Risk is not fate. It reflects systems. Data alone will not prepare us, but mapping risk can help reveal structural gaps that require attention—globally and locally.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the next post, I will unpack the indicators behind the index and look at why some regions score significantly higher than others. The spatial story of vulnerability is as much about people as it is about place.
